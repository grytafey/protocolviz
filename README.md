# ProtocolViz

ProtocolViz is a project to visualize and clarify the triage decisions made in providing civil legal assistance and to show the effects of these decisions with real-life data.  D3, a JavaScript library, can create an interactive flow-chart that can both provide the big-picture view of the triage process and allow us to drill-down to individual decisions and their impact.
